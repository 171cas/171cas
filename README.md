## Bio
"I think, therefore I code."
An all time math lover who carries the passion of learning, algorithms and problem solving to the software industry developing efficient and elegant applications. 
This passion was born when I was gifted a Chess board as my 7th year birthday present. Ever since, I have always been interested in learning about Calculus, Math, Abstract Thinking, and everything related to it. This motivation was the reason why I was accepted into the most prestigious colleges of Venezuela, and it also served me as my first job; Math and Physics Teacher.

I recently completed the acclaimed coding bootcamp App Academy, a six month immersive full time software developing course (Full Stack) with over 1,000 hours of classes, homework and projects.
I gained skills in different technologies such as: React, Redux, Python, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, C++, Git, Javascript, HTML, CSS, among many others. I, also, had the luck to personally meet wonderful people and develop multiple group projects together.

My current goal, as a family man, is to start a stable and long term career in a tech company where I can develop myself professionally, personally and make a good impact in people's life.

My hobbies are high fantasy novels, chess (Online Rating 2035), exercise, music, painting, travel and radio personality activities.
